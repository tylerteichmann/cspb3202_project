Submission Instruction
Deliverables
1. A git with working codes or notebook (commented and explained)
2. A video clip of a demo(s)- either .mp4 youtube link, unlisted, or transformed to .gif image (you can leave those links in the report or embed in the notebook)
3. Report with following Contents (no page limit)
	-Short overview of what your project is about (e.g. you're building /testing certain RL models in certain environments; yes you can test your algorithm in more than 1 environment if your goal is to test an algorithm(s) performances in different settings)
	-Approach: explain your environment, your choice of model(s), the methods and purpose of testing and experiments, explain any trouble shooting required.
	-Result: show the result and interpretation of your experiment. Any iterative improvements summary.
	-Conclusion, discussion, reflection, or suggestions for future improvements or future ideas.
	-Reference: Please include all relevant links (git, video, etc)


Evaluation rubric (totoal 40 pts)
1. Does it include the clear overview on what the project is about? (4)
2. Does it explain how the environment works and what the game rules are? (4)
3. Does it explain clearly the model(s) of choices, the methods and purpose of tests and experiments? (7)
4. Does it show problem solving procedure- e.g. how the author solved and improved when an algorithm doesn't work well. Note that it's not about debugging or programming/implementation, but about when a correctly implemented algorithm wasn't enough for the problem and the author had to modify/add some features or techniques, or compare with another model, etc. (7)
5. Does it include the results summary, interpretation of experiments and visualization (e.g. performance comparison table, graphs etc)? (7)
6. Does it include discussion (what went well or not and why), and suggestions for improvements or future work? (5)
7. Does it include all deliverables (3)
	- git with codes or notebooks
	- writeup (you can consider notebook as a writeup if the notebook contains all needed contents and explanation)
	- demo clips
	- proper quote or reference
8. Is the writeup well organized overall? Overall writeup quality. (3)
